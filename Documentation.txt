Created a new react app using facebook's famous tool and then cleared out the unwanted files from the boiler
project. Set the margin and padding to zero because React by default sets 10px to both.
The first page of any website is it's login page so I started observing the login page of Spotify and made
a plan according to it. It contained login through facebook, google, apple and phone number, but implementing
all of them in this project would have been complex and maybe unnecessary so I stick to just ask the user
to login through google.
Designed the login page but faced problem getting a horizontal line tag <hr> so I continued without that
thinking that it will be done later.
Explored the spotify api and learned the authorization guide
Fetched the access token from the url
Learned a new thing that underscore should be put before temporary variables so as to distinguish them from
local variables. Used a spotify api wrapper to store the token from spotify and used it to fetch the original 
spotify user's details.
Created state context and reducer for state management
